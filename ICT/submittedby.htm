        I'm Prince Timothy S. Clemente student at Honorato C. Perez Sr. Memorial Science High School I am 13 years old and I live in Bucot Aliaga,Nueva Ecija Philippines My favorite thing to do is playing badminton with my friends and the color that caught my attention is the color green because it symbolizes, the nature which I love the most,because God created it and we need to protect the nature and we need to appreciate what God gives to us, even it was a terrible tragedy because God have plans for us like in the bible verse Jeremiah 29:11 "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
